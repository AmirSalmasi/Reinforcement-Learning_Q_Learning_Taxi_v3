# Reinforcement-Learning_Q_Learning_Taxi_v3
In this project, we aim to solve the problem of finding the optimal policy for a taxi agent in a grid environment. The agent needs to navigate the grid, pick up a passenger, and drop them off at their destination while maximizing the reward and minimizing the travel time.
